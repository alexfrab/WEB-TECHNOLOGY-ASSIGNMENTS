     2. Ensure `script.js` and `styles.css` are in the same directory for functionality and styling.

3. **Assignment 3: jQuery-Based Form Validation**
   - Files: `Assignment3.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`
   - Description: Enhances form validation using jQuery for dynamic error handling and validation feedback.
   - **How to Run:**
     1. Open `Assignment3.html` in a web browser.
     2. Ensure `script.js` and `styles.css` are correctly linked.
     3. jQuery must be included in the HTML file or be available via a CDN.

4. **Assignment 4: PHP & MySQL CRUD Operations**
   - Files: `create.php`, `crud_ajax.sql`, `db.php`, `delete.php`, `index.html`, `read.php`, `update.php`, `styles.css`
   - Description: Implements a user management system where users can be added, viewed, updated, and deleted using PHP and MySQL.
   - **How to Run:**
     1. Start a local server (XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP).
     2. Import `crud_ajax.sql` into MySQL to set up the database.
     3. Place all files in the `htdocs` (for XAMPP) or equivalent directory.
     4. Open `http://localhost/Assignment4/index.html` in a browser.

5. **Assignment 5: AngularJS Library Management System**
   - Files: `app.js`, `api.php`, `db.php`, `index.html`
   - Description: A simple Library Management System built using AngularJS for frontend interaction and PHP as a backend API to fetch and manage books.
   - **How to Run:**
     1. Install Node.js if not already installed.
     2. Navigate to the `Assignment5` directory.
     3. Run `node app.js` to start the server.
     4. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in a browser.
     5. Ensure the backend API (`api.php`) and database (`db.php`) are properly configured.

6. **Assignment 6: AJAX-Based Live Search**
   - Files: `search.html`, `search.php`, `styles.css`, `db.php`
   - Description: Implements an AJAX-powered live search functionality where users can dynamically search a database without reloading the page.
   - **How to Run:**
     1. Start a local server (XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP).
     2. Import any necessary SQL file (`db.php` handles database connection).
     3. Place all files in the `htdocs` (for XAMPP) or equivalent directory.
     4. Open `http://localhost/Assignment6/search.html` in a browser.
